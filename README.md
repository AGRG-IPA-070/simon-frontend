> Front-end interface for SIMON

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

`SIMON` is a powerful, flexible, open-source and easy to use knowledge discovery application. <a href="https://dashboard.genular.org" target="_blank">(click here for demo)</a>
Currently `SIMON` implements automated machine learning and statistical data discovery features
that will help you to easily illustrate dynamic relationships and provide you with a structural sense of your data.

Goal of this project is to make unified user interface that will empower anyone to extract meaningful information from their data and enable them to rapidly use machine learning algorithms. `It gives you freedom and control over your own models.` genular is an entirely open source organization, if you wish to learn more visit us [here](https://genular.org)

While `SIMON` can be used in across many different fields, 
our focus here is scientific community so we can enable scientist and other researchers in the field to quickly prototype around their data and get meaningful results out of it.

## Why is this so awesome?
* :file_folder: **Feature learning** You can discover relevant trends and patterns with ease, that would usually take years of manual handcrafting.
* :package: **Visualize & analyze** Exploratory analysis of machine learning results will give you instant insights with help of many different visualization algorithms.
* :arrows_counterclockwise: **Share your Data** You can share your results with others, or download them for external use
* :lock: **Encryption** You can encrypt data in transit with secure https connections or use it in dedicated private environment
* :lock: **Privacy** Since data is hosted on your own servers you don't have to worry about someone else is looking after your data


## Installation Quickstart
To install and configure `SIMON` you will need basic knowledge of Linux, how to set up databases (MySQL) and web server (Apache, nginx) together with R and PHP configuration.
Installation instructions are located in [this](INSTALL.md) file.
If you believe you don't have necessarily skills to do so, you could always ask a friend to help you or check out our [demo](https://dashboard.genular.org)

#### Contributing, writing code
Contributions are very much welcome!

If you need any help, please contact us at info@genular.com.

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it.
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack Club's `master` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.

    abstract = {Machine learning holds considerable promise for understanding complex biological processes such as vaccine responses. Capturing interindividual variability is essential to increase the statistical power necessary for building more accurate predictive models. However, available approaches have difficulty coping with incomplete datasets which is often the case when combining studies. Additionally, there are hundreds of algorithms available and no simple way to find the optimal one. Here, we developed Sequential Iterative Modelling "OverNight" or SIMON, an automated machine learning system that compares results from 128 different algorithms and is particularly suitable for datasets containing many missing values. We applied SIMON to data from five clinical studies of seasonal influenza vaccination. The results reveal previously unrecognized CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets strongly associated with a robust antibody response to influenza antigens. These results demonstrate that SIMON can greatly speed up the choice of analysis modalities. Hence, it is a highly useful approach for data-driven hypothesis generation from disparate clinical datasets. Our strategy could be used to gain biological insight from ever-expanding heterogeneous datasets that are publicly available.},
