## Intro

`SIMON` is a powerful, flexible, open-source and easy to use knowledge discovery application. <a href="https://dashboard.genular.org" target="_blank">(click here for demo)</a>
Currently `SIMON` implements automated machine learning (autoML) and statistical data discovery features
that will help you to easily illustrate dynamic relationships and provide you with a structural sense of your data.

Goal of this project is to make unified user interface that will empower anyone to extract meaningful information from their data and enable them to rapidly use machine learning algorithms. `It gives you freedom and control over your own models.` genular is an entirely open source organization, if you wish to learn more visit us [here](https://genular.org)

While `SIMON` can be used in across many different fields, 
our focus here is scientific community so we can enable scientist and other researchers in the field to quickly prototype around their data and get meaningful results out of it.

## Why is this so awesome?
* :chart: **automated machine learning** Automation of machine learning process for predictive analytics
* :file_folder: **feature discovery** You can discover relevant trends and patterns inside your data with ease, that would usually take years of manual handcrafting
* :package: **exploratory data analysis** Visual analysis of automated machine learning results will give you instant insights with help of many different visualization algorithms
* :arrows_counterclockwise: **sharing is caring** You can share your results with others, deploy your models instantly or download your data for external use
* :closed_lock_with_key: **privacy and security** By hosting `SIMON` on your own dedicated servers you don't have to worry about someone else is looking after your data

## Features

<img alt="SIMON UI screenshot" src=".github/static/simon_analysis.png" align="right" width="500px"/>

* **200+** automated machine learning algorithms to choose from
* nicely designed **drag&drop** user interface to easily apply data modeling techniques
* supports **local** and **cloud** backend storage architecture
* for-each model you can compare between **34 model performance measures**
* visual **data analysis** that supports *clustering* and *correlation graphs*
* visual **feature analysis** with dot-plots that supports **280 visual styles**
* visual **model comparison** with *box-and-whisker* style plots
* public dataset repository import to **easily import** and analyze pre-published data
* Integrated **SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays)** technique for finding significant genes in a set of microarray experiments
* Supports translation to **multiple languages**

## Installation Quickstart

### Easy
This section describes the process of pulling a pre-built version of `SIMON` from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
If you are beginner this is recommended way to start `SIMON`. This can also be very handy for developers for development without polluting the host machine.
The `SIMON` source code includes a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/genular/simon-backend/blob/master/documentation/docker_images/Dockerfile).

#### Requirements
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (`version 17.05` or later is required for building the image).

#### Running SIMON Container
In order to run a test instance of `SIMON` we first need to prepare the environment. 
Lets pull the [genular/simon](https://cloud.docker.com/u/genular/repository/docker/genular/simon) image from DockerHub. Then run a Docker container with appropriately mounted volumes and port mapping. By default the container would run with a local file-system inside of it.

```bash
docker container pull genular/simon
docker run --rm \
    --detach \
    --network=host \
    --name genular \
    --tty \
    --interactive \
    --env IS_DOCKER='true' \
    --publish 3010:3010 \
    --publish 3011:3011 \
    --publish 3012:3012 \
    --publish 3013:3013 \
    genular:simon
```
Once the container is started you can open SIMON on `http://localhost:3010` and create your account.

##### Important
To exit/shutdown `SIMON` you must use following command when you are finished with your analytical work, otherwise all your current session data will be lost:

```bash
# Then get the docker container id using this command
docker ps
# Commit changes to the container
docker commit <container_id> genular:simon
```

### Advanced
To install and configure `SIMON` from source you will need basic knowledge of Linux, how to set up databases (MySQL) and web server (Apache, nginx) together with R and PHP configuration.
> Installation instructions are located in [this file](https://github.com/genular/simon-frontend/blob/master/INSTALL.md). 
> You can find semi-automated bash installation script [here](https://github.com/genular/simon-backend/blob/master/documentation/installation/install_dependencies.sh), that can also help you to get started.
